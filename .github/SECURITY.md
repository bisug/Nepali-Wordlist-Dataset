## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is a static wordlist dataset, "vulnerabilities" typically refer to:

- Malformed data that could crash parsers.
- Injection of malicious scripts (unlikely in plain text, but theoretically possible in documentation or web demos).

If you discover any issue, please report it via:

1. GitHub Issues (for non-sensitive data issues).
2. Emailing the maintainer (for sensitive concerns).

We will investigate and release a patched version of the dataset immediately.
